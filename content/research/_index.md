      title: Background
      subtitle:
      text: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid pediatric cancer accounting for 8-10% of cancers in childhood and 15% of pediatric oncology deaths. Neuroblastoma arises from the developing sympatho-adrenal lineage during the embryonic development. It is a genetically heterogeneous disease with a diverse clinical outcome ranging from spontaneous tumour regression to malignant metastatic disease with relapses and poor response to current therapy. While patients whose tumours undergo spontaneous regression or maturation (ganglioneuroblastomas, ganglioneuromas) have mostly an excellent outcome, only a minority of children with aggressive tumours can be cured. Despite the advances in genomic and trancriptomic analyses, the identification of molecular determinants of the very poor therapeutic response and worst outcome of high-risk patients remains challenging. Thus, a better understanding of the biology of both, spontaneously regressing/maturing and aggressive tumours is of high interest to develop novel treatment approaches.

      title: Our research
      subtitle:
      text: One of our main research interests is the biology of high-risk neuroblastoma. Patients that are diagnosed and stratified as high-risk suffer from relapses and metastases and their survival rate remains below 40% despite intensive multimodal treatment. To date there are only a few driver genes linked to the pathogenesis of high-risk neuroblastoma, most of which are not directly druggable and frequently insufficient response to therapy is observed. In our group, we employ state-of-the-art technologies, such as genome-wide and targeted CRISPR/Cas9 screens and single cell genomics and epigenomics in order to identify the oncogenic drivers and epigenetic dependencies in tumours from high-risk neuroblastoma patients. We have established in vitro and in vivo preclinical patient-derived models for functional assays and drug testing for precision oncology that can be translated into existing and new clinical trials with the ultimate goal to improve treatment outcomes and survival of high-risk neuroblastoma patients.
