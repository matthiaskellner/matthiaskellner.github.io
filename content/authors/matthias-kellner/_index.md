I am currently studying Data Science and Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Hagenberg, after having completed my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at the same university. At CCRI, I am working as a software developer in Sabine Taschner-Mandl’s group. My task is to develop a web service that provides easy access to existing AI models and algorithms for the detection of alternative lengthening of telomeres in fluorescence in situ hybridization microscopy images.
